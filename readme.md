# UI item to improve UX

UI as they are existing are boring and not suitable for good UX. This is the way we improved it.


## Getting Started

It is all basic web :
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

So you can clone the directory and open in your browser index.html

## Our UI's
### Form Input improved (ui-input)
Form input UI allows to :
- Always have the label visible
- if no entry, make the label highly visible 
- if entry, make the entry highly visible

files:
- index.html, ui-input.js, ui-input.css

### search Box (ui-search)
Search Box allows to:
- see the what is important
- make appearing the search input by clicking on an icon (e.g. magnifier)
- launch the search (if enter is pressed or an icon is clicked)

files:

    index.html, ui-search.js, ui-search.css

### Selection Process (ui-selection-process)
The users need to select an item and could have many criterii.
Example : Trousers > Women > blue
This UI allows the user to select using input list and autocompletion.
___________________________
! Trousers > Women > blue !
